# Affinidi Demo Browser App powered by [Affinidi SDK](https://github.com/affinityproject/affinidi-core-sdk)

This is a react application that has a basic UI with some of the functionalities that [Affinidi SDK](https://github.com/affinityproject/affinidi-core-sdk) offers. You can use this app to play around with some of the functionalities offered in the Affinidi SDK and eventually enable SSI for your own application(s).

## Installation

`npm install`

Install using npm instead of yarn because the current package-lock.json was
generated using npm.

## Environment

API key is required to use this application. You can get the API key [here](https://apikey.affinidi.com/)

Using the API KEY:
- Option 1: create an `.env` file by `cp .env.example .env` and replacing the value in the `<<>>`
  
- Option 2: Add the API key created above to your package.json into the `start` and `build` commands like this:

```
......
  "scripts": {
    "start": "REACT_APP_ENVIRONMENT=prod REACT_APP_API_KEY=........ react-scripts start",
    "build": "REACT_APP_ENVIRONMENT=prod REACT_APP_API_KEY=........ react-scripts build",
......
```

### Build

`npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />

Finally, run your own react application powered with SSI capabilities from Affinidi SDK on your local machine.
